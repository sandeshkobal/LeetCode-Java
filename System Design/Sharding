Database sharding is the process of making partitions of data in a database or search engine, 
such that the data is divided into various smaller distinct chunks, or shards.
Each shard could be a table, a Postgres schema, or a different physical database held on a separate database server instance.
Some data within the database remains present in all shards (vertical sharding), 
but some appear only in single shards (horizontal sharding). 
The following figure illustrates vertical sharding and horizontal sharding.
