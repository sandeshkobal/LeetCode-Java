Database sharding is the process of making partitions of data in a database or search engine, 
such that the data is divided into various smaller distinct chunks, or shards.
Each shard could be a table, a Postgres schema, or a different physical database held on a separate database server instance.
Some data within the database remains present in all shards (vertical sharding), different columns in differen databses combined with primary key.
but some appear only in single shards (horizontal sharding). 

you can shard date on users location .. 
for twitter you can shard data with timestamp
