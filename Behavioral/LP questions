Tell me a time when you had to deal with a tight deadline and couldn't deliver in time

Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. 
Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

• Walk us through a time when you helped a customer through a difficult process and what that looked like.
• Who was your most difficult customer?

• Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client's expectation. 
  What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?

• When you're working with a large number of customers, it's tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. 
  How do you go about prioritizing your customers' needs?

• Tell the story of the last time you had to apologize to someone.

Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job".
Give me a example of when you took a risk and it failed.

• Tell me about a time when you had to leave a task unfinished.

• Tell me about a time when you had to work on a project with unclear responsibilities.

Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. 
They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
Tell me a time when you created an innovative product.

• Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.

• Tell me about a time when you invented something.

Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. 
They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
• Tell me about a time when you observed two business opportunities to improve ROI, 
and how did you determine that they were connected.

• Tell me about a time when you were wrong.

• Tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information.

Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves.
They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
• How do you find the time to stay inspired, acquire new knowledge, innovate in your work?

• Tell me about a time when you influenced a change by only asking questions.

• Tell me about a time when you solved a problem through just superior knowledge or observation.

Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. 
They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. 
Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. 
We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
• Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a poor performer on your team.

• Tell me about a time when you mentored someone.

Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. 
Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes.
Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
• Tell me about a time when you could have stopped working but persisted.

• Tell me about a time when you couldn't meet your own expectations on a project.

• Tell me about a time when a team member didn't meet your expectations on a project.

Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. 
They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
• Tell me about a time when you proposed a new business.

• Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.

• Tell me about a time when you went way beyond the scope of the project and delivered.

Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. 
Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study.
We value calculated risk taking.
• Describe how you would handle a busy situation where three people are waiting for help from you.

• Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.

• Tell me about a time when you took a calculated risk.

• Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn't very responsive. What did you do?

Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. 
There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.
•Tell me about a time where you thought of a clever new way to save money for the company.

• Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time or resources.

Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
• Tell me a time when you earned trust of a group.

• What would you do if you found out that your closest friend at work was stealing.

• Tell me about a time when you had to tell someone a harsh truth.

Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.
• Tell me about a time when you had to dive deep into the data and the results you achieved.

• Give me two examples of when you did more than what was required in any job experience.

Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
• Tell me about the most difficult interaction you had at work.

• Tell me about a time when you had to step up and disagree with a team members approach.

• If your direct manager was instructing you to do something you disagreed with, how would you handle it?

Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
• Tell me about a time where you overcame an obstacle and delivered results.

• By providing an example, tell me when you have had to handle a variety of assignments. Describe the results.

• What is the most difficult situation you have ever faced in your life? How did you handle it?

• Give me an example of a time when you were 75% of the way through a project, and you had to pivot strategy-how were you able to make that into a success story?
