Why are you a good fit for this role?
I am very hardworker  & very consistentand I have prooven it from time to time.
I have customer obsession and I have went above and beyond to come with feature 
or solve problems for customer's satisfaction. notifcation lang, meeting at 2 am, 
analytics on data resource to roles mapping, roles to users mapping. 
Though my distributed system knowlege does not reflect my on my resume. 
I keep reading and watching videos and blogs about ditriburted off the shelf technologies and how it works 
that shows my eagerness to learn.
