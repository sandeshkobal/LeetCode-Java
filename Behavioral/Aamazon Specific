Why do you want to work at amazon? 
At amazon is everything operates at very large scale. 
To have hand on experience to at that scale will be the best. 
Working at amazon is very unique that you wont get anywhere else. 
I have friends working for amazon more than 3 years and have great things to say about amazon. 
This company is full of challenges.. and if you like taking them its a fun place to be. Work pressure is subjective. 
The only thing I can say is that there is enough work to do. If you can do it smartly there is no work pressure.
