What is the interviewer looking for: 
The interviewer is looking for your involvement in the decision-making and post-decision process.

And how well did you demonstrate followership to support a decision that you disagree?


Notification with multiple languages
   Situation: 
      I have handled the Notification with multiple languages. One of the things I did not like that customer has to change the session language to 
      change the template body of a given language.  I brough up this fact to my director and PM how it is very cumborsome and possibly irritating for customers.
      It wasn't in the cycle. So PM and director hold off on that. 
   Task : 
      I worked on it as a side project communicating to other team how to read available languages and API to modify notification in a lang other than
      session language.
      I created a feature enhancement reuest to PM and through support in 4-5 monthd 
      we got 10-14 customer requesting for that feature.
   Action : 
      I already had an idea with my initial research so developing that wasnt that difficult. 
   Result : 
      PM got good reviews from customer about this feature and in one of the meeting I got praise for from VP and PM.
