Be natural, perfect answers can often come off as disingenuous. So dont try get to perfect answer. 
For behavioral and product questions, don't overspeak. Candidates who drone on are less interesting and don't appear confident. 
This is a huge candidate killer. You have to appear confident in your answers. 

What about this team is interesting?
This is new team so there are gonna be tons of problem to solve and it is gonna be fast paced.
All the cloud technologies involved in elastic search It would be great to have hands on expirence on 
these technologies. 

Why do you want to work at amazon? 
At amazon is everything operates at very large scale. 
To have hand on experience to at that scale will be the best. 
Working at amazon is very unique that you wont get anywhere else. 
I have friends working for amazon more than 3 years and have great things to say about amazon. 
This company is full of challenges.. and if you like taking them its a fun place to be. Work pressure is subjective. 
The only thing I can say is that there is enough work to do. If you can do it smartly there is no work pressure.

    including me. 
  Task :

***************** Notification Audits *****************
Customer Obsession / 
Invent and Simplify /

  S:
  A lot of bug were coming saying why this notification was not deleivered and why is this delivered but not this. 
  Why specific user is not getting emails. There were so many hrs we used to spend with support and customer OWC to figure out why.
  Bu turning on fine logs .. going through the logs and coming with the reasons. 
  Setting could be turned on off. 
  T:
    I was thinking what we can we do this to reduce this timing.
    So I suggested an idea of having audit logs and having ESS scheduled job tu purge the requests old request. 
  A:
    So introduce a simple one table and took a snapshot of all the settings and user's information before passing down the call to another team. 
    Wrote confluence page how to figure out the issues for specific users with sample sqls.
    Wrote ESS job to purge old entries. 
  R:
    I was able to resolve almost all issues in matters of couple hrs.

  Notification with multiple languages
     Situation: 
        I have handled the Notification with multiple languages. 
        One of the things I did not like that customer has to change the session language to 
        change the template body of a given language. 
     Task : 
        I brough up this fact to my director and PM how it is very cumborsome and possibly irritating for customers. 
        All language datas was 
        always handled by session language and thats how frameword worked.
     Action : 
        After much of other dealines and work this got pushed out almost 5-6 months. 
        I brought that back up with PM and PM confirmed that he has received compainls from customer about this. 
        Still this wasnt on the priority list as it was more. 
        I started creating APIs that sould handle different languages of save and edit. 
     Result : 
        When it was around 9 customers it started to get on priority list. 
        But by that time i had initial API working so making that to a feature didnt take that long.
        

***************** Having meetings at night for customers otherside of the world *****************
        Customer was in Kuwait and Support was from india  timing was not working out. 
        Had a meeting at 2AM usa/Kuwait9am and resolved the issue. Customer was very happy that from developemnt team 
        was so conirn about the customer satisfaction too.

  List of Users asssigned to given list of roles
        S: 
          Role and User management you can see user in a role and on user you can see what roles are assigned. 
          There was no way to see the list of User asssigned to given combinations of roles/privileges/resources. 
        T:
          I checked how is this possible and is it feasible or would take too long ... 
          well it was base idea but given long list of users and roles perfromace issues were clearly visible.
        A:
          Suggested that this will be nice thing to have. 
        R:
          Month ago GRC is doing that idea and i am their backend support from ASE. 
        
***************** Notification Hidden copy *****************  - Invent and Simplify
Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.
Disagreement  /
innovative  /
  S & T:
    The default user category was provided outside of the box and had seed data init. 
    default will get newly added seed data  but what about manually created category how would they get additional events and templates?
    So the plan was to create sql script and keep adding missing event and notifications to the user created categories.
  A : 
    It was frowned upon to write sql scripts and upgrading a POD was taking a lot of time because of so many scripts. 
    Knowing that management decided to have sql scripts and get exception on it. It talked about how this script will run every time and we have make returnable script and 
    Maintaining it would be challaging and after few days of though process came up with the solution.
    create two seeded copies and one would be hidden and one would be for default and there wonâ€™t be any operations on hidden copy.
  R :
    Manager loved this solution and and this approach to solve.  



***************** Import/export user categories and notifications *****************
FSM related. lot of reading about their architecture and documatition was old. 
The reply from team wasnt that helpful at all. 
Code base found out the recent project looked at the code. 
and made sence out of it ... reverse engineering. 



***************** User Categories Notification backend and front end - Earn trust/ helping ***************** 
Helped a teammate - earn trust /
Dealt with poor performer /
  S & T:
    We had a enhancement request in a way that we can create User groups and that group would have its own password settings 
    notification settings and own email templates. I was assigned the task for restructure of the tables and backend APIs. 
    A junior engineer was assigned a task for developing UI. The speed at we both worked was very different. 
    The dealine was tight for this one and i could see at the speed we goinf we wont be able to finish the project. 
  A:
    I asked if he need help and I can start implementing a Application module which sits on top of the backend APIs. 
    He was reluctant at first but I offered a starbusck coffee it is easy to talk over the coffee than at a desk. 
    So we had coffee and found out he was going through difficult time and I insisted that I would do the application module
    and he doesnt have to worry about it. 
 R:
    We are very good friends now and more than just professional relations. 


***************** Difficult bug solved ***************** 
Erratic behavior reset password page 
System was behaving very erratic I sometimes would take a minute or sometimes a take 10 second to load the page.
I had all the OWC with customer couple times but it worked good at scheduled time. 
I asked their IT manager to give a user some privileges so they can create FINEST log session and do the steps. 
I got Java mission control file I learned the tool how to use that 
and found out that Oracle access manager was the one taking avg responding time significantly high. 
Ended up talking to teams to figure out who manages this particular part turned out the OAM was running low and then 
I had to contact cloud ops team to resolve this issue. 

***************** Difficult project - DB design going from one language at time to multiple languages 
                  + user categories *****************
difficult problems worked on / 
Stressful situation / 
unclear requirements / 

  S & T: 
    We were supporting a notification email one language at time you can create a template.
    in the language you want and can enable that template. Mission was to support all installed languages in the system 
    so that users would get an email notifications in their preferred language. 
    So every tempalte would have all installed languages.
    Moreover, we had user categories that would have their separate notifications. 
    So instead of flat notifications settings and tempalte it became 1 level dependant on user category.
    And customers can create as many groups they want. 
    The default user category was provided outside of the box and had seed data init. 
    default will get newly added seed data  but what about manually created category how would they get additional events and templates?
    So the plan was to create sql script and keep adding missing event and notifications to the user created categories.
  A:
    1 by 1 started work through requirements and design. 
    Very tight deadlines. 
  R: 
    Delivered with bang 


***************** JWT project dues in 3 weeks *****************
Stressful situation \ 
unclear requirements \
disagreements \ 

  S & T :
    I was assigned the project bcz of unplanned absence of our teammate and I was asked to take over the project.
    Prior to this they had 1 month of of meeting and and intenal designs and roadmap which was still unclear when i started working 
    on this project. I was handed out workin progress git commit and I no idea what is happening. The dealighnes were so tight. 
    I had the disagreement about the tables names and some of the constraints and one missing column.
    Which I showed that to my manager why and hows it is wrong. I knew that means the WIP commit was of no use to me anymore. 
    So dealign became almsot just 2 week with me working on this almost by scratch. Though WIP gave me some star wont deny that.
  A : 
    Went through meeting notes, had to reques access to couple pages to my PM. 
    Couple meeting with my boss to clarify doubt.
    I communicated the changes and we all agreed on the change I will be making 
    there were two types of unknown in this project creating tables and and 
    creating entity object and VO objects with translations in it. 
    I asked a help from one of my friends that worked on EO and VO had a meeting with him like an hrs. 
  R: 
    I was able to deliver the project on time. 
    


3 I am very social person so make a point to talk to all my team members and other teams too:
  Other teammates know me as compare to the people who have been there 7=10 year in irvine office. 
  I quickly learn who know what and interesting problems they solve. 
  This helps when sometimes you need help you know who can help you the best and from who you can learn. 
  
4 I like mentoring/helping people at myst last job I have helped/metored 2 people about understanding ADF framefork and deployments issues. 
  I put a lot of efforts to understand tiny details before i have session with them. 
  There are two motivational factors i consider first i dont want to come up as not knowing thing and still mentoring/helping. 
  I like building connection and helping someone and I feel so good about it. 

5. good at documentation really lame to say that but i think having written docs helps a lot of people. 
   This is again some sort of helping people so it motivates me to do it. 
  

What is your dream job?
Where i can build cool things and genuine connections with people. 
Wher i can call my team as my friends too and work towards common goal.
Mentoring and coaching others that motivates me a lot ....

What keeps you going?
Helping people .. same story as Accesibility traning. 
I go above and beyond if pople are relying on me. 


*****************
Tell me a time when you had to deal with a tight deadline and couldn't deliver in time? 
  Talk about JWT project and how you pulled out from the current project which was IMPOrt export, 
  other project I was working took a almost a week more bcz of JWT project unclear reqirements and and all that. 
  I did apologies for that but they knew it was unavoidable. 
  It was just unfortunate situation where there was no buffer for before deadlines. 
  did silver transaction and talked to QA team and made sure they test both broze and silver. 

*****************
Tell me a time when you disagreed with your manager
JWT, nitifaction multilanguage and Seeddata of notifications hidden copy

Tell me a time when you did something innovative
Notification Audits, Combination of roles => to roles, 
Mutilangage UI. 

*****************
Tell me a time when you helped a peer
Notification back end and front end.


*****************
Tell the story of the last time you had to apologise to someone.
        Why this gets asked: 
          This question exposes two abilities: your willingness to admit to mistakes (no-one is perfect) 
          and your ability to manage a team.

        What you should say: 
          Don't say you've never had to do it. That makes you look arrogant. 
          Admit to a mistake, but place the emphasis on how you apologised and â€” 
          even more importantly â€” what you did afterwards 
          to fix the underlying issue.
    
    I missed a meeting at the office I was getting a coffee and wanted to take a walk. 
    I was so focused on one customer bug and after solving i needed a break. 
    By the time i returned meeting was over and i relized that seeing my emails 
    Tt was genuinely unintentional and I was embarrassed, I immediately apologized and tried to clear the air with my boss.
    I added the oracle calander on my personal phone and also had text services on and never missed a meeting after that. 
    
    JWT project pulled from current project which was import export,
    and couldnt deliver the second project on dealine. 
    Apologies when i reply to message little late :/

What would you do if you found out that your closest friend at work was stealing?
  Why this gets asked: 
    This measures your loyalty to the company versus your loyalty to an employee.
    Both matter, but the second tends to matter more.
  What you should say: 
    Emphasise that you'd want to be clear about the nature of the offence before deciding on a response.
