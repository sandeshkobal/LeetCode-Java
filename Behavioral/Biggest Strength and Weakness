1 Taking initiative : 
  STAR Framamework: 
  Situation : 
    There were Accesibility bugs coming up on our product. They were assigned to all teammates and everyone was strugguling with those 
    inclusing me. 
  Task : 
    To solve these bugs. 
  Action : 
    Talked to other team found out some documentation. A month letter found out there was training on Accessiblity.
    I enrolled into that traning gathered all information and shared that with the team, Though I am responsible for accessibilyt bugs not which i dont mind. 
  Result:
    We feel lot confident responding to accessibility bug and now all my teammates have all reliabled information/documentations 
    if they have to solve those bugs/

 STAR Framamework: 
 Situation: 
    I have handled the Notification with multiple languages. One of the things I did not like that customer has to change the session language to 
    change the template body of a given language. 
 Task : 
    I brough up this fact to my director and PM how it is very cumborsome and possibly erritating for customers. All language datas was 
    always handled by session language and thats how frameword worked.
 Action : 
    After much of other dealines and work this got pushed out almost 5-6 months. I brought that back up with PM and PM confirmed that he has received compainls from customer about this. 
    Still this wasnt on the priority list as it was more. I started creating APIs that sould handle different languages of save and edit. 
 Result : 
    When it was around 9 customers it started to get on priority list. But by that time i had initial API working so making that to a feature didnt take that long.
     
2 I am very social person so make a point to talk to all my team members: 
  I quickly learn who know what and interesting problems they solve. 
  This helps when sometimes you need help you know who can help you the best and from who you can learn.
