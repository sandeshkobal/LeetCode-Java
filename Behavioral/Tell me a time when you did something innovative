This is also Customer Obsession : 

S:
A lot of bug were coming saying why this notification was not deleivered and why is this delivered but not this. 
Why specific user is not getting emails. There were so many hrs we used to spend with support and customer OWC to figure out why.
Bu turning on fine logs .. going through the logs and coming with the reasons. 
Setting could be turned on off. 

T:
  I was thinking what we can we do this to reduce this timing.
  So I suggested an idea of having audit logs and having ESS scheduled job tu purge the requests old request. 
A:
  So introduce a simple one table and took a snapshot of all the settings and user's information before passing down the call to another team. 
  Wrote confluence page how to figure out the issues for specific users with sample sqls and meaning. 
R:
  I was able to resolve almost all issues in matters of couple hrs.
