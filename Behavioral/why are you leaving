Working from pleasanton empty office is really it is like working remotely.  I am social person and I want to be part of the team. 
Better oportunities - I think I reached the peak at oracle in terms of learning.  I want to learn something new and grow a current skill.
Honestly who doesnt love better opportunity and pay.
