Why Roblox? 
  Try to answer : 
    Why are you interested in the company?
    Why are you interested in the job?
    
I like roblox's missionis to "bring the world together through play". 
The concept is very unique - user-generated worlds allowing people to imagine, create, and play together. 
Roblox has been doing that very succesfully and it is just a start of the bigger picture.
It handles 2.5 million concurrent users and billions of events per day. 
Working here would be very challanging and unique experience from my growth along with compnay's growth. 

As the company is growing fast I can imagine the amout of responsibility is gonna be great for any position.
That means a lot exposure to learn and be successful at roblox. 
I have C++ strong so working here would be enhancing my skill set at the same time adding skillset bcz of 
more responsibility and uniques challanges. 


Eg : 
Users jumping from one game to another looks very challenging and works real time.
