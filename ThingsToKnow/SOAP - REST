SOAP web services : Simple Object Access Protocol
	SOAP is a protocol which is used to interchange data between applications which are built on different programming languages. SOAP is built upon the XML specification and works with the HTTP protocol. This makes it a perfect for usage within web applications. The SOAP building blocks consist of a SOAP Message. SOAP message is XML which has soapEnvelope, header and body.

SOAP has : WSDL, XSD/DTD/ WSDL is an XML format for describing network services as a set of 
endpoints operating on messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. 
The operations and messages are described abstractly, and then bound to a concrete network protocol and message 
format to define an endpoint. 

Sample: 
          <wsdl:operation name="exportData">
            	<wsdl:input message="tns:RolesMigrationService_exportData"/>
            	<wsdl:output message="tns:RolesMigrationService_exportDataResponse"/>
            	<wsdl:fault name="ServiceException" message="errors:ServiceException"/>
        	</wsdl:operation>






XSD OR DTD  will have the definition of datatypes of each element. 
XSD : 
    <element name="importData">
        	<complexType>
            <sequence>
                <element name="importData" type="ns0:ImportData"/>
                <element name="importControl" type="ns0:ImportControl"/>
            </sequence>
        	</complexType>
    </element>
   OR
  <xs:element name="note">
    <xs:complexType>
      <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element name="to" type="xs:string"/>
        <xs:element name="from" type="xs:string"/>
        <xs:element name="heading" type="xs:string"/>
        <xs:element name="body" type="xs:string"/>
      </xs:sequence>
    </xs:complexType>
  </xs:element>

DTD :  Document type definition 
<!ELEMENT note (to, from, heading, body)>
<!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT heading (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)>

REST is a simple, light-weight and a fast web service as compared to the web services of WSDL and SOAP.
HTTP is the protocol used in REST. The HTTP requests are used in order to read and write data. 
The four methods which are GET, PUT, POST and DELETE are used in REST based web services. 
Therefore, the HTTP protocol is used by REST in order to perform the four operations
which are create, read, update and delete (CRUD). 

The difference between SOAP and REST is that the SOAP is a protocol while REST is an architectural style.
