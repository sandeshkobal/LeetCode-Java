**Undirected/Bi-directional Graph**

 * To have fully connected graph, graph should have n-1 edges. 
 * Valid Tree ? -> For the graph to be a valid tree, it must have exactly n - 1 edges and when you traverse the graph all nodes must be visited. 


**Minimum Spanning Tree:** 
  * In an Bidirectiona(OR undirected) weighted graph, there is a tree (N nodes, N - 1 edges so no cycle) that connects all nodes in the graph, and the sum of path weights are minimum.
