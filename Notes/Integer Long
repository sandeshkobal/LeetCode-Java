These types are not pass by reference. 
1 Integer is pass by value, not by reference. 
  Changing the reference inside a method won't be reflected into the passed-in reference in the calling method.
2 Integer is immutable. 
  There's no such method like Integer#set(i). You could otherwise just make use of it.

someFunction(){
  Integer i = new Integer(0);
  someFunction2(i);
  // here i is still 0 
}
someFunction2(Integer i){
  i= 5;
}
