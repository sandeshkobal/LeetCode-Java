Integer String Long are immutable objects. 
There's no such method like IntegerObj.set(i). 

someFunction(){
  Integer i = new Integer(0);
  someFunction2(i);
  // here i is still 0 
}
someFunction2(Integer i){
  i= 5; // wont change the value of an i
}

Remeber INT_MIN = -INT_MIN 
Also % operator retians the -ve sign of first number -1%2 = 1 but 1%-2 = 0
