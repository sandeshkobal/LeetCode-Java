String[] aString = str.split(" ");
for(String st : aString){
     System.out.print("a="+st);
}
"  4 33"
a=a=a=4a=33

str.split(" +"); will match one or more space 
a=a=4a=33
to split for with . in a string you have to put "[.]"
because . is special character that matches everything 

 aString = str.split("\\W+");
 return only words : 
 String str = "id-INT, name-STRING,";
 [id, INT, name, STRING]


StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder(new String(".").repeat(size));
This is good to have when you need base case with 'n' repeat characters OR String.
