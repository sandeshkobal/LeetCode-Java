Whenever you expose a web service / api endpoint, 
you need to implement a rate limiter to prevent abuse of the service (DOS attacks).
Implement a RateLimiter Class with an isAllow method. 
Every request comes in with a unique clientID, deny a request if that client has 
made more than 100 requests in the past second.

Deque<Integer> dq = new  LinkedList<>();
You can have Deque in HashMap<CliendId,Deque> Deque will contain timestamps
  if Deque.size()<100
    addLast(T)
when Deque becomes 100 check if the first element and last element timestap 
  if currentTimeStamp - peekFisrt() < 1 sec 
    pollFirst()
    addLast(T)
  else 
    Deny 
    
For thread safety you can use ConcurrentLinkedDeque.



If you use hasmap for timestamp/1000 => sec then we dont get accurate result 
for example for 1.8 sec to 2.8 sec
