    Imagine that this is a tree every node is separate by dot. 
    but there could be duplicate nodes for eg. frame has a lot of "text" nodes but we want the text node which has property 
    prop and value as "asdf" then whithin that text node we want raft node and that is what we want to return.
            gui
              - frame
                  - text
                      - property prop="asdf"
                      - raft
                  - text
                      - property crop="adf"
                      - raft
              - pic
