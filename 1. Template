To understand more of what is asked ..
Try some dummy inputs and see if you are answering those questions right ..... 
Ask more questions for invalid inputs .. or say you are assuming valid input for simplicity ...

Think if you can do 2+ passes on data set and figure out if you can solve?

whenever you are multiplying or negating or adding numbers think if its gonna be overflow? 
remeber INT_MIN = -INT_MIN 
also % operator retians the -ve sign of first number -1%2 = 1 but 1%-2 = 0
